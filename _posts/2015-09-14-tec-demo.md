First demo is up and running!

We can announce very happily, that we managed to get our first little tecdemo ready :)

With the latest git code you should now be abled to simulate a simple 1-to-1 session including session-generation, WebCam-access and video-stream capability.
From now on we will work on n-to-n communication and also on a nicer state handling.

Stay tuned for more #progress!
