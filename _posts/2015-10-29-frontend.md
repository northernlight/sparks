In the last days we focused on building our landing page and worked on the design of Sparks.
Now we can provide a basic good-looking frontend for the login page aka session creation and joining.
We tried to follow a pretty clean but elegant design-pattern.
Our landing page will generally consist only of a little form to create and join web sessions, furtermore
some information about the project and links to the Github respository and a contact form will be provided.

We also did some refactoring on the backend, because we experienced some crashes of the server in the past.
That bug could now be eliminated and the server backend works like a charm ;)

Everything is still in the making, but the basic design structure is already cleared, so only small adjustments need to made there
and, of course, the frontend/backend binding at the frontpage has to be considered, too.

Stay tuned for more information :)
