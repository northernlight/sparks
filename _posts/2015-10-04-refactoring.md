In the previous week(s) we began to work on our code structure of the backend.
When we built the code to show our first TechDemo, we didn't pay much attention on beauty and flexibility of our coding.
Now, after the first successful demo, we are trying to refactor that code to ensure expandability and modularity.

Unfortunately, we couldn't manage to get 1-on-1 support working with our new structure until now, but don't worry - we'll fix that soon :)

Furthermore we plan to design parts of our fronend within the next days, also design patterns for the website and UI sketches will be disscussed.

We'll let you know, when we have any news!
