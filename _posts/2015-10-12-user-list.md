Last week we went out to get some feedback for our project idea and also did a technical review with a collegue of ours.
That way we got some new ideas and discussed how to face different issues regarding load-balancing and bandwidth distribution.

In addition to the feedback we worked on out frontend design. We managed to get our Polymer UI up and running.
After that we included a dynamic User List that should act as an additional feature for the Users. The list includes a list of all acitve users who joined the session.
At first every User gets a pseudo random Username that can be changed during the session and should be automatically updated.

The last mentioned functionality isn't completely working at the moment, but it sure will after some adjustments.

In the next days we want to push our design further concerning the respresentation and alignment of the different streams.
It's also planned to add more functionality like e.g. ending the session.

Stay tuned for more information!
