Welcome to Sparks!

Our Sparks project is trying to realize and establish an easy and secure audio- and video-connection between serveral 
participants all over the world.

The goal is to provide a application - only used in the browser - that implements e.g. videochatrooms that can be easily 
set up by entering a username and generating a unique room-id afterwards. Once the meeting room is created, it should be
possible to invite and add friends or business partners to join the call without any further registration.

We would like to ensure a secure connection with using encrypted P2P-connections created with the WebRTC API.
Furthermore we will work on a traffic load-balancing algorithm to make sure every user can maintain a fluent stream.

But for now, we have just set up this basic blog, where you will be abled to follow the project progress.
